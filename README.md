# Cloud Storage Chrome OS App

A simple Chrome OS App that showcases the [`chrome.fileSystemProvider`](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/fileSystemProvider) API by giving you access to [Cloud Storage Buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/overview) directly in the Files.app.

Please, note that it creates a **read-only** mount point at the Files app. To perform the read-write operations, please follow the [Google Cloud Storage documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/).

Get it on the Chrome Web Store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ibfbhbegfkamboeglpnianlggahglbfi
